# Nano_degree_DAND_Udacity

Hi every, I am Weber Huang.  I am learning data analysis.  
This page contains the project from my Udacity Data Analyst Nano Degree(DAND) online course. 

Here below are links to my projects. They are accomplished by SQL, R and python. Please feel free to giving me any suggestion about my works:   
* 1.[Explore Weather Trend](https://github.com/Weber12321/Nano_degree_DAND_Udacity/blob/master/Term_1/Project%20I%20_Explore%20Weather%20Trends/Explore%20Weather%20Trend.R)   
* 2.[Explore US bikeshare data](https://github.com/Weber12321/Nano_degree_DAND_Udacity/blob/master/Term_1/Project%20II_Explore%20US%20bikeshare%20data/project2/Explore%20US%20bikeshare%20data.py)   
* 3.[TMDb movie data investigation](https://github.com/Weber12321/Nano_degree_DAND_Udacity/blob/master/Term_1/Project%20III_Investigate%20tmdb-movie%20dataset/Projec3/TMDb%20movie%20data%20investigation.ipynb)   
* 4.[Analyze_ab_test_results_notebook](https://github.com/Weber12321/Nano_degree_DAND_Udacity/blob/master/Term_1/ProjectIV_Analyze%20AB%20test%20results/AnalyzeABTestResults%202/Analyze_ab_test_results_notebook.ipynb)    

And this is the link for some free datasets to practice:   
* [dataset for praticing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTlVmknRRnfy_4eTrjw5hYGaiQim5ctr9naaRd4V9du2B5bxpd8FEH3KtDgp8qVekw7Cj1GLk1IXdZi/pub?embedded=True)

I'll soon join the military service. This github page is not yet being well constructed and there are still some parts I have to put on to make the whole page more readable, after finishing the military service I'll tune it better. Wish you have a good day :)
